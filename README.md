# Inciedent-Response-with-Red-Blue-Team

This is an inciedent response report that my team and I created in our Cybersecurity course at Appalachian State University. We generated a fake company to create the response plan for.

The red team report is an anlysis of penetration testing on another team in the class. 

The blue team response is my teams reponse to penetration testing of our server from another team.
